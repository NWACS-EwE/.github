# NWACS-EwE
The purpose of this site is to make facilitate the development, updates, and reproducibility of NWACS models and their applications. 
## Organization Overview
The NWACS-EwE Github organization is currently structured with separate code repositories for different tasks.
### Proccess diet data
The 'diet' repositories contains a set of scripts for combining diet data, querying prey taxonomy, and estimating diet proportions as Dirichlet multinomial distributions.
### Extract data from stock assessments
The 'process_stock_assessments' and 'NWACS-fULL-model-inputs' repositories contain scripts that extract outputs from stock assessment report files and formats them for use in the NWACS EwE models.
### Analyze benthic invertebrate data
The 'NBI_benthic_inverts' repository contains data and code to analyze benthic invertebrate data from NOAA's National Benthic Inventory repository and derive inputs for NWACS EwE models.
### ERP tradeoff analysis (coming soon)
The 'erp' repository contains codes to generate multisim input files for the Ecosim tradeoff analysis, produce the tradeoff plots, and return the ERPs.
